# iThinking
It is a general idea and not an application for a specific work, so that, God willing, it will have many applications that will move people for many centuries forward, and will solve countless problems of the most difficult problems, and what made me write this day is news in which I saw my dream starting to be realized by others, It may be a little painful feeling, but rather a very painful feeling, after this idea I wanted to implement for my BA graduation project in the Faculty of Information Technology at the University of Benghazi, where I started thinking about it before, but I was encouraged to start implementing it in 2017 a year before my graduation, and before To know that this is very impossible, because I will need a large team of experts besides my modest experience that can be increased in an extraordinarily rapid manner, as an expert in neurology to answer many questions standing in the way of achieving my dream.


## (Explanation of the idea without practical experiments or detailed scientific study (without knowledge
This project aims to accelerate human work by shortening the time of movement that begins with a command from the brain, and then the matter is transmitted to the organ that in turn will perform a specific function, so that this brain passage is intercepted by a device on the human body to receive it on his behalf and the device sends this command to another assistant device A replacement for an organ (for example, because he was amputated).
From here came the idea, and my mind started to be filled with so many applications that can solve the most difficult and complex problems.


## (Various applications without practical experiments or detailed scientific study (without knowledge
* By reading the device of the nerve signals sent to and from the brain through the spinal cord, a signal can be intercepted and transmitted to another device that examines, strengthens and clarifies it for a device to read it and put it on a graph that details some medical matters (as in many devices that exist today)
* From the same principle mentioned in the previous point, this signal can be transmitted to the doctor so that the doctor is in pain and knows the location of the pain, its severity, and its medical location to facilitate the diagnosis.
* Brain signals can also be intercepted during the sleep of a person with autism (for example) to control his dream and teach him some things, or to understand the nature of their brains and their way of thinking about the dream.


### Note
> All of the aforementioned is in the field of medicine only, and not all that came to mind, there are many medical applications through this idea, and it can be used in the educational and life fields as well, and governments can benefit from it in crimes and criminal cases. Determining actually lying without percentages may be imprecise, as is the case now.


### needs
It is an idea that needs an expert in the field of neurology and excellent doctors, surgeons, experts in designing electronic devices, a project manager, a developer and a software designer, as well as great financial and scientific support, in order for the team to be complete and ready to work.
Unfortunately, this is not available from the moment of thinking about this idea to this moment, when someone who possesses all these ingredients came and preceded me to implement them, try them and work with them.
